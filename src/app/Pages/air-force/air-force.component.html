      <p>
        I enlisted in the Air Force in 2016, attending basic training in May.
        After graduating from BMT, I attended Aerospace Medical technician
        technical school in San Antonio. My first base was Keesler AFB in
        Biloxi, MS where I worked in the general surgery clinic. Next I moved to
        Eglin AFB where I worked in the Emergency Department and Intensive Care
        Unit.
