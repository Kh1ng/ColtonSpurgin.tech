    I plan on keeping some notes on choices I made during the design and learning process here.

    I thought it would be a cool idea to translate my school work into a backend that can run my school work in a terminal on this site. 
    I'm going to start by consuming the open trivia API to play a simple game and completing my front end then moving to the back end. I'm considering 
    rust or spring boot for my backend. Springboot is definitely the easier option but rust seems like a good challenge for me.
